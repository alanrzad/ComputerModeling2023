## Settings and Configuration
First of all i must say that maybe it is because of my lack of experience working with this kind of simulation tools and etc, but in the beggining when i tried to open the project in the eclipse IDE following the instructions given in the class, Nothing worked at all, there were several errors en the IDE did not want to recognice the xml file as well.
## Workspace Problems
I tried rebooting and nothing work, then i realized there was already a project in the system, and i think that was causing some conflicts so i deleted everything and then cloned again my repository and tried opening a new workspace, now it was working but still with some problems.
## xml. file not working
When i open the xml file as an eclipse application as said in the instructions, it opened correctly but there was no option to start designing the diagram for the simulation, literally there was no tab of "Design" and the simulation tab was blocked, after a few tries an many attempts of deleting and cloning a clean project from my repository it finally worked, then i started with the instructions given.
## LAN connection not working
Later when i was trying to do the simulation i realized the windows machine was not recognizing the simulation from the xml file so it took me about two hours of attempts checking a lot of things because maybe i did something in the project of eclipse that i was not supposed to do until it finally worked.
## First Simulation
The first simulation did not work so i continued to HW2 for the log files, and after this the simulation finally worked and it seemed to be working correctly but the car went only in a straight line, it was faster than before but there was problems with the collisions.
## EXTRA NOTES
I tried to fix this later but when i check it there was again a lot of errors in the eclipse IDE and again the xml file did not work, so i had to re do it and submit it.
Of course after submission i tried to solve the errors but again the workspace errors appeared, and again my diagram diassapeared, when everything worked again and tried to do a simulation now the car was not moving at all.
## Conlussion
I think this project is okay and i actually liked it, however with all the errors and constant files lose it was very difficult to keep working on it, my goal is to keep checking what can i fix before i give the notebooks back and to think about what should i have done better when i started the project, however i think i learned some new things.
